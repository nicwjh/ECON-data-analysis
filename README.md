# TO-DO
## Question 3 - Analysis 
1. Analyze how chains differ from independent clinics in their costs/behavior (at least ~half a page of writing)

Basic ideas discussed 11/28 

- If larger chains have lower average cost than independent clinics 

- Tracking variable changes from independent providers to firms

- Comment on missing variables 

- Run regressions (can do model selection to select predictors) 

- Drug dosage from independent to chain 

## Notes 11/17 
observation in final data: provider_num, year -> rpt_num 

each provider number & year has a unique rpt_num

rpt_num -> worksheet, line, column, value 

rpt_num -> prvdr_num, year, var1, var2

provider number and year map to report number

report number maps to a worksheet, line, column, value. 

check Alex's chart he uploaded 

nmrc and alpha have values in the data

use worksheet, line, coluimn to map to variable codes that Alex gave to get variable names 

chain_identity: important to know what chains own the clinics

epo variable: be careful. some people don't report it correctly 

one strategy: epo_total * 1000 / cost ~ $8-12. if not in this range, can delete 
- in documentation, don't spend too much time on this 

listen to the podcast(first 25 minutes)/read the paper for context
